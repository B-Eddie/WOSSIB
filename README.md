## How Focus Mode Works

### For Users:

1. Use `/focus <duration> <mode>` to start a focus session (duration in minutes)
2. You'll get a focus role that restricts access to distracting channels
3. Use `/focus_status` to check remaining time
4. Use `/unfocus` to end early or wait for automatic completion
5. Use `/focus_list` to see who else is in focus mode

### Focus Modes:

- `deep` - Maximum restrictions, study resources only
- `study_group` - Access to study channels and voice rooms
- `subject` - Restricted to specific subject channels

## Commands

### Focus Commands

- `/focus <duration> <mode>` - Start a focus session (duration in minutes)
- `/unfocus` - End your current focus session
- `/focus_status` - Check session status
- `/focus_list` - Show all users currently in focus mode

### Grade Conversion

- `/ib_to_percent <grade>` - Convert IB grade to percentage
- `/percent_to_ib <percentage>` - Convert percentage to IB grade
- `/calculate_total <subjects...> <tok_ee_bonus>` - Calculate total IB score

### Exam Management

## Troubleshooting

### Duplicate Commands

- Make sure you have `GUILD_ID` set in your `.env` file
- The bot will only sync commands to the specific guild, preventing duplicates

### Focus Mode Not Working

- Ensure you've configured channel permissions to restrict focus roles from sending messages
- Focus roles are created automatically when users start sessions
- Check that the bot role is positioned above the roles it needs to manage

### Permission Errors

- Make sure the bot has the required permissions in your server
- Check that the bot role is positioned above the roles it needs to manage
