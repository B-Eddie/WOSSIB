## How It Works

### Focus Mode System
1. When a user starts a focus session, they receive a temporary role
2. The role restricts access to distracting channels (configured by server admins)
3. The bot automatically removes the role when the session ends
4. Users receive completion notifications with session statistics

### IB Score Conversion
- Uses standard IB grade boundaries for conversion
- Accounts for diploma requirements (minimum 24 points, no grade below 3)
- Includes TOK/EE bonus points calculation

### Exam Countdown
- Stores exam dates and provides real-time countdowns
- Automatically removes past exams
- Supports multiple exam tracking for the same grade level

## Customization

### Channel Restrictions
To set up channel restrictions for focus mode:
1. Create channels you want to restrict during focus mode
2. Modify channel permissions to deny access to focus mode roles
3. The bot will automatically assign these roles during focus sessions

### Role Permissions
The bot creates roles with the following naming pattern:
- `ðŸŽ¯ Focus Mode (Deep)`
- `ðŸŽ¯ Focus Mode (Study_group)`
- `ðŸŽ¯ Focus Mode (Subject)`

Configure channel permissions for these roles as needed.

## Data Storage
Currently uses in-memory storage. For production deployment, consider implementing:
- Database storage for persistent data
- User preference storage
- Session history tracking

## Support
This bot is designed for IB study servers where all users are in the same grade level. For multi-grade servers, additional role management may be needed.

## License
This project is open source. Feel free to modify and distribute as needed for your IB study community.
